# mixed-messages

Codecademy portfolio project

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

### Project Objectives:

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites:

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

### Interpretation

To randomize output, we need input data. We want at least three different pieces to work with. These can be some pre-build sentences, words, dates or random numbers. We will be using Fork as a git client instead of CL. Program will be tested in CL however.

1. Get data to randomize. 3 arrays with multiple strings.
2. Build a function to get random values from arrays.
3. Format and output string to user.
4. Prompt user to retry or quit **optional**.
